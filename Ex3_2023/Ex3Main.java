/**
 * Ex3, School of Computer Science, Ariel University.
 *
 * This is the "main" class for Ex3.
 * Do NOT change this class!!
 *
 * Basic roles:
 * 1. Space bar starts the game (and pause it).
 * 2. 'c' changes the cyclic mode (default is true).
 * 3. In manual mode: 'w'-up, 'a'-left, 'x'-down, 'd'-right.
 * 4. The Game (and the Gamer) parameters are defined in the Info class.
 * 4. Your are asked to implement the following classes: Index2D, Map, Ex3Algo.
 * 5. Keep in mind that in order to implement this assignment - you might want to implement few additional classes (on top of adding JUnit classes).
 * 6. The dame has 5 main "levels" ([0,4]). You are request to run&test them all.
 * 7. After each run, the system prints (in the terminal, in red) a String with your game results -
 * you are asked to upload your results (at least one for each level), part of your grade will be based on those results.
