/**
 * This interface represents a 2D map as a raster matrix or maze.
 * The data is assumed to be a rectangular 2D matrix (not a ragged array).
 * This interface includes the following functionalities:
 * 1. init, copy
 * 2. set the map to be cyclic or not cyclic.
 * 3. shortest path (obstacle avoiding)
 * 4. shortest distances from a source coordinate to each entry in this map (obstacle avoiding).
 * 5. fill a connected component with a new color
 *
 * If this map is cyclic:
 * 1. the pixel to the left of (0,i) is (getWidth()-1,i).
 * 2. the pixel to the right of (getWidth()-1,i) is (0,i).
 * 3. the pixel above (j,getHeight()-1) is (j,0).
 * 4. the pixel below (j,0) is (j,getHeight()-1).
 * Where 0<=i<getWidth(), 0<=j<getWidth().
